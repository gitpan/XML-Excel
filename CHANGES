	-Fixed a problem "Can't call method Value on undefined value".  Added line:
	defined($cell) ? push(@cols_data, $cell->Value) : push(@cols_data, undef);
	to push an undef value if no data is available for that cell.
	Thanks to Jean-Marc VANEL.

	-Added declare_xml() and declare_doctype() functions
	to allow for xml declaration and doctype declarations.
