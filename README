Module: XML::Excel

Description:
    XML::Excel provides functions to easily transform Excel documents into XML.  The module uses 
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel to parse Excel files and put into perl data structure.  The perl data 
    structure is then written into xml data structure.  XML::Excel allows to create your own Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
    object with defaults that fit your needs or just use defaults.  I will enhance it's functionality as time permits.  
    Efficiency is very important in parsing and writting large docs so one of the next enhancements will include 
    an option for creating a data structure or write as you parse.  That will eliminate the need for storing a data 
    structure before writting xml.  The data structure has it's own benefits, since it allows you to provide your 
    own structure or modify the existing one before you write to xml.  Any ideas or requests for enhancements or 
    added functionality are very welcomed, so please feel free to email them to me.
